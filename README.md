## Electronic Track Search

A React web app which searches the following sites for information on a track release and provides results of DJ mixes which feature the track:
- Discogs
- MixesDB
- Soundcloud

My favourite searches for this engine:
- Sleeparchive - Fifth Station
- Blue Hour - Common Ground
- Oscar Mulero - Generator
- Polar Inertia - Vertical Ice

Recent additions:
- Calls a NodeJS app (hosted on Heroku) which holds my API keys

To do:
Migrate the Fetch functionality into the above backend.
